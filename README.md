I am a Software Engineer and ICT Consultant that love solving problems through technology, from planning the structure of each project to the transition to production. I actively contribute to each stage of their construction to obtain the best possible result. A good impresion of the product for end users can define its success and love for it.

When I'm not programming or attending consultancies, I'm doing the "usual things" of the CEOs and Founders of a company.
