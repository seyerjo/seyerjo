<p align="justify">
I am a Software Developer and I love finding and solving problems through technology. I am involved in all phases of the projects I work on, from planning to production, to ensure that the final result is the best it can be. If users are satisfied with the final product, it will translate to its success and love for it.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Throughout my professional career, in addition to Software Development, I have acquired another set of skills that allow me to help all those who trust my work every day: Computer Systems Administration, Information Security, ICT Management or Business Processes Development, among others.
</p>
<p align="justify">
When I am not programming or attending consultancies, I am doing the "typical things" of the CEOs and Founders of a company, collaborating with the ICT Community or learning new things.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I am currently involved in the study of the application of programming in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
