<p align="justify">
I am a Software Engineer and ICT Consultant who loves solving problems through technology, from planning the structure of each project to its transition to production. I actively contribute in each stage of its construction to obtain the best possible result. A good impression of the product for the end users can define its success and love for it.

When I'm not programming or attending consultancies, I'm doing the "typical things" of the CEOs and Founders of a company or collaborating with the Techie Community.
