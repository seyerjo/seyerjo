<p align="justify">
I am a Software Engineer and ICT Consultant who loves solving problems through technology, from planning the structure of each project to its transition to production. I actively contribute in each stage of its construction to obtain the best possible result. A good impression of the product for the end users can define its success and love for it.

<p align="justify">
When I'm not programming or attending consultancies, I'm doing the "typical things" of the CEOs and Founders of a company or collaborating with the Techie Community.
