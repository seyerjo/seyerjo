<p align="justify">
I am a Software Developer and Information Technologies Consultant, and I love finding and solving problems through technology. I am involved in all phases of the projects I work on, from planning to production, to ensure that the final result is the best it can be. If users are satisfied with the final product, it will translate to its success and love for it.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Throughout my professional career, in addition to Software Development, I have acquired another set of skills that allow me to help all those who trust my work every day: Systems Administration, Information and Computer Security, ICT Management, Business Processes, among others.

<p align="justify">
When I am not programming or doing consulting, I am doing the "typical things" of the CEOs and Founders of a company or collaborating with the ICT Community.
