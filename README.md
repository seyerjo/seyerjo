<br/>

<p align="justify">
I am an IT Consultant, specialising in Software Development for the Web, mobile devices and for Windows, Linux and Mac OS desktops, as well as in the application of Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence to Business Processes.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I love looking for and finding solutions to problems through technology and I get involved in all phases of the projects I work on, from planning to production, to ensure that the end result is the best possible.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Throughout my professional career I have acquired another set of skills that allow me to help every day all those people who rely on my work: Systems Administration, Information Security or IT Infrastructure and Process Management, among many others.
</p>

<p align="justify">
When I'm not programming or consulting, I'm doing the "typical things" of CEOs and Founders of a company, collaborating with the IT Community or learning new things.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Currently I am deeply involved in the study of the practical application of newly emerging Data Science and Artificial Intelligence based tools to increase the productivity of IT processes through programming.
